### The von Neumann Architecture

Von Neumann's report described a computer built from six basic "organs":

  - A "central arithmetical" unit that performed calculations
  - A "central control" unit that was responsible for interpreting and sequencing the program's instructions
  - Memory, which stores the program's instructions, its constant data, and any variables it manipulates as it executes
  - A persistent recording medium that provides permanent storage for data and programs: punched cards and teletype tape filled this role in von Neumann's day
  - Input and output organs for reading and writing the persistent storage device

An implied seventh organ is the *bus* that connects all of the other organs together and allows them to exchange information.
